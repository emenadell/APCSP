    <p class = "p"> The project I am talking about/ displaying is my I-search from my freshman year english class. This project lasted the whole second semester, we found a topic that was important to us, researched it, and then wrote multiple different essays about it later putting them all together into one project at the end of the year. I chose how social media affects young girls and sets unrealistic standards for them about what they are supposed to act like and look like to please society. This is important because it leads to many insecure young girls which can result in depression and eating disorders to name a few. My project ended up being 27 pages and I am proud of it because it is an issue that I am passionate about.  </p>

    <p class = "p"> I did a presentation in the beginning of the year in AP art history on the artist Helen Frankenthaler and how she changed the art world. This is my favorite subject so I Love talking about it and I find it fasinating. Helen grew up in New York City at the height of artistry there. She created color field painting which is about feeling and emotion rather than the artist trying to tell the viewer a story through the art. She  just wanted the viewer to escape and interpret the painting how they wanted to which I like. This changed the art world because paintings like this were not a norm back then. She struggled in life because men were dominant in the art world and women were not usually making a lot of money from painting, however she ended up becoming really famous and doing just fine.</p>
